              Re-verse offers you the option to return or exchange items purchased on the platform for any reason within the specified return/exchange period typically 7 days, though this may varyâ€” please check the product details page for specific information.
              Returns will be picked up from the same address where the product was delivered. You are welcome to try on a product, but we request that it remains unused and in its original condition, including all tags and packaging. If the item is received with a seal tag, please ensure it remains attached and intact to avoid any issues during the return or exchange process.
