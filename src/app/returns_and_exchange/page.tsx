          <strong>Limited Return/Exchange Period:</strong>
          <p>
            Certain products, like fine jewellery, watches, and select items susceptible 
            to damage, can only be returned or exchanged within a limited window.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Special Handling for Intimate Items:</strong>
          <p>
            Due to their intimate nature, items such as innerwear, sleepwear, and lingerie 
            are handled differently. Only self-ship returns are allowed, and pick-up services 
            are not available. Additionally, these items cannot be exchanged.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Condition of Items for Return/Exchange:</strong>
          <p>
            All items to be returned or exchanged must be unused and in their original condition, 
            with all original tags and packaging intact. For example, shoes must be returned in 
            the original shoe box.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exchange Policy:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If exchanging for the same size or a different size of the same style, the replacement item will be provided free of cost.
            </li>
            <li>
              If exchanging for another item:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the exchanged item is of higher value, you will be charged the price difference.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the exchanged item is of lower value, the price difference will be refunded once the original item is successfully picked up.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
              Refunds for exchanges will be processed once the original item is successfully picked up.
